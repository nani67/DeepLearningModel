Deep Learning model using Keras

This is a project of recognizing the output value (or bit value) out of the given 32 bits of information.
This was actually implemented to prevent a loooong time of searching for a larger dataset.

This project was created for my professor as a part of a website containing code samples (like of GitHub) for the college students, developed by the college students.

How to run this?

Step 1: Install packages "*Keras*"

Step 2: run the Python file belonging to "training" first. It will create a .h5 file

Step 3: run the Python file belonging to "test or implementation". It will run the model which was saved before for prediction.

Thank you for visiting. *Happy Coding*
